Follow tutorial here: [https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)

Copied from repo subdirectory with command: `npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"`

Note: create-next-app is doing the heavy lifting, Git does not really allow for users to clone subdirectories.
